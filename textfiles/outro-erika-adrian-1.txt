ERIKA: …
ERIKA: Sorry. It’s a lot.
ADRIAN: Do you need a moment?
ERIKA: No. Let’s—let’s keep going. You said that you needed my statement about something?
ADRIAN: Yes. Erika, what was August doing on the day before his death? Did you notice anything out of the ordinary? 
ERIKA: I don’t think I noticed anything strange. But let me think back. What was he doing yesterday?
(Player looks through the memories and types in their response. Omitted from this demo.)
ADRIAN: Okay. I’ve got that all down. 
ADRIAN: Thank you, Erika.
ERIKA: Adrian…
ERIKA: I don’t think I’m ever going to be okay again.
ADRIAN: I know. 
ADRIAN: I’m so sorry.
ERIKA: Can I go now?
ADRIAN: Yeah. That’s all I needed.
ADRIAN: August probably left some things that you might want in his desk. It’s not strictly allowed, but…
ADRIAN: Anyway.
ADRIAN: Just remember what I said. Goodbye, Erika.
