ADRIAN: Hey, Erika.
ADRIAN: I’d ask you how you’re doing, but…
ERIKA: …
ERIKA: Is it true?
ADRIAN: It is. He’s dead.
ERIKA: I—
ERIKA: I know. I just needed to hear you say it.
ADRIAN: …
ADRIAN: It’s so f*cking sh*tty.
ADRIAN: You know, he always got into work before me. I half expected that I’d see him at his desk when I got in today, just like always. And I saw his goddamn body last night.
ADRIAN: I’m gonna miss him like hell.
ERIKA: …
ERIKA: Yeah. Me too.
ADRIAN: I have to take a statement from you about the hours leading up to his death. I know it’s a lot, but it’s protocol… anyway. I’ll answer your questions first.
