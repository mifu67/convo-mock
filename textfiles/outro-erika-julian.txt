ERIKA: I'm sorry, Jules.
JULIAN: Yeah. I'm sorry, too.
JULIAN: It must be harder for you. I mean, you guys were so in love—everyone could see it—and… anyway. I’m sorry. I wish I could have done something.
ERIKA: Actually...
ERIKA: I’ve been trying to figure out what really happened. Something just doesn’t feel right to me about all of this.
ERIKA: Can you help me?
JULIAN: Are you kidding? Of course I'll help.
ERIKA: Thank you, Julian.
JULIAN: What are we waiting for? Let's go.
