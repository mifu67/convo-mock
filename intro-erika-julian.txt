ERIKA: Julian. You're here.
JULIAN: August gave me a copy of the key yesterday, but I went to a friend’s house last night. 
ERIKA: You know what happened, right?
JULIAN: Yeah. Adrian called me. I’m supposed to give a statement tomorrow about the hours leading up to his death.
JULIAN: Because apparently, I’m the last person who saw him alive before he walked over to a park and blew his brains out.
JULIAN: F*cking hell. Suicide. I don’t believe it for a f*cking instant.
